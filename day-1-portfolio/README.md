Remember:

Create your site on Codepen.io (or github, if you want to make a full-fledged site!)
Search and Ask if you're stuck. that's what the group is for :)
Share your codepen/github link in the Facebook Group, as a comment under the corresponding day's prompt post.
Hashtag your tweets with #30Days30Sites
Review other people's work and provide feedback (that's how you'll get feedbacks on yours in return)
Your website can be as simple and complex as you want it to be, so be creative!

We can't wait to see what you come up with :)
